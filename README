A GUI to create Network map for Internet Security.
HoneyMap is a software utility program which provides a simple to use GUI interface to
construct a computer network map. The map consists of routers, switches, servers, personal
computers, wireless access points, laptops and firewall devices. Devices in the map are
connected to each other in some way using line connections which actually represents a
network connection (LAN / Wireless). These maps are later converted to appropriate
configuration file for a popular low interaction honeypot call honeyd. That configuration file
is passed as argument to honeyd which later simulates a complete computer network. One
can also use HoneyMap to share the network design with other fellow designers using
popular image format SVG.
The project started a long time back but couldn't be completed as I and deepsa got busy with other
stuff. so here is the idea and concept for anyone interested to take it up.
Also if this is to be carried on, I'd like it to be on Qt, as I have too moved to Qt from Gtk.
